Code Review – Week 2
Reviewer: Kelebogile Dlamini

This script is designed to test and validate API endpoints for the South African eTenders OCDS API. It systematically tries multiple possible endpoints, verifies their responses, and falls back to the Swagger documentation if none respond successfully. Once a working endpoint is found, it runs further tests for both API-side filtering (searchText parameter) and client-side search, ensuring that tender data can be searched reliably.

Strengths

Systematic endpoint discovery
The script smartly tests several endpoint variations and gracefully falls back to the Swagger API documentation. Excellent investigative strategy for uncertain APIs.
Robust error handling
Uses try/except effectively to catch network and JSON parsing errors, providing readable error messages without crashing.
Readable and engaging logging
The use of emojis and structured print statements makes it easy to follow test progress and results — especially useful for debugging.
Comprehensive testing approach
Both server-side (searchText) and client-side filtering mechanisms are tested, ensuring reliability even if the API’s built-in search fails.


Areas for Improvement
Code structure and duplication
The file currently includes multiple distinct test scenarios (endpoint discovery, client-side search, and keyword testing) in one script.
Consider refactoring them into separate functions or files for better readability and maintainability.
The requests.get() logic is repeated several times; a reusable helper function (e.g., fetch_json()) would reduce redundancy.
Pagination support
Fetching only pageSize=100 results may miss additional tenders.
If the API supports pagination, implement a loop to request all available pages.
Swagger integration
Currently, the script prints available paths but doesn’t re-test them.
We could extend this to automatically retry the endpoints retrieved from Swagger to identify additional working URLs.
Date handling consistency
The script uses 30 days in one place and 60 days in another.
Standardize or make this configurable through a variable or argument.
Output clarity
The raw JSON dump is truncated after 500 characters, which is good for debugging.
For ongoing testing, consider printing structured summaries (e.g., number of tenders found, top tender titles) instead of raw JSON.


Suggested Improvements
Create a helper function to centralize HTTP requests:
def fetch_json(url, params=None, timeout=15):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=timeout, headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Request failed: {e}")
        return None

Overall Assessment
A strong exploratory testing script with clear output, practical testing coverage, and good error handling. Once refactored into modular components and enhanced with pagination, it will be well-suited for production-level API testing and documentation validation.

Code Review: Company Profile Management
1. Overview

The Company Profile Management module enables registered teams to create, view, and update their company profiles within the system.
Each team must maintain an up-to-date business profile, including certifications, industry sectors, services, geographic coverage, and contact information.
These profiles are essential for readiness scoring and filtering companies based on qualifications and sectors.

2. Functionality Summary

Features Implemented:

Create and update company profiles linked to the authenticated user’s team_id.

Retrieve the existing company profile for the logged-in team.

Dynamically load profile data in the frontend through API calls.

Provide selectable lists of industry sectors, provinces, and certifications through dedicated endpoints.

Validate and serialize data using Pydantic models.

Manage database interactions using SQLAlchemy ORM.

Endpoints:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/company/options/industries	Returns a list of valid industry sectors
GET	/company/options/provinces	Returns a list of available provinces
GET	/company/options/certifications	Returns available certifications
POST	/company/profiles	Creates or updates a company profile
GET	/company/profiles	Retrieves the company profile for the current user’s team
3. Code Structure
File	Description
models/company_profile.py	Defines CompanyProfileBase, CompanyProfileCreate, CompanyProfileUpdate, and response schemas using Pydantic
routes/company.py	Implements FastAPI routes for company profile creation, retrieval, and options fetching
frontend/profile.js	Handles frontend form data population using API responses
4. Strengths

Clear and modular use of Pydantic models, with separate classes for base, create, update, and response models.

Effective use of dependency injection (Depends(get_db) and Depends(get_current_user)), improving testability and maintainability.

Proper error handling and transaction rollback to prevent inconsistent database states.

Modular and descriptive API routes, improving documentation and readability.

Frontend integration is straightforward, with dynamic population of form fields based on the user’s data.

5. Areas for Improvement

-Duplicate Pydantic Models
CompanyProfileCreate is defined both in the models and in the routes.
Recommendation: Use a single schema definition by importing it from a central schemas module to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy.

-Use of Mutable Default Arguments
Fields such as
certifications: Optional[Dict] = {}
geographic_coverage: Optional[Dict] = {}

-use mutable default values that can lead to shared state between instances.
Recommendation: Replace with Field(default_factory=dict).

-Inconsistent Data Representation
certifications and operating_provinces are stored as strings or dictionaries inconsistently.
Recommendation: Store them in a JSON field using SQLAlchemy’s JSON data type for more flexibility and cleaner serialization.

-Missing Response Models
Endpoints currently return raw dictionaries without a defined response_model.
Recommendation: Add response_model=CompanyProfileResponse in the route definitions to enforce response validation and improve the generated OpenAPI documentation.

6.Validation Enhancements
Add validators for fields such as phone numbers, experience years, and turnover to prevent invalid entries.
Example:

@field_validator("years_of_experience")
def validate_experience(cls, value):
    if value < 0:
        raise ValueError("Years of experience cannot be negative")
    return value


7. Frontend Improvements

Handle cases where the province list or certifications are empty or invalid more gracefully.

Provide confirmation or alert messages upon successful profile submission.

8. Recommendations for Future Enhancements

Readiness Scoring: Integrate profile completeness and sector data to automatically calculate company readiness scores.


Week 4
Code Reviewer: Hope Lerato Nkoana

Executive Summary

Our FastAPI application is  well-structured and functional with a good foundation. The architecture follows FastAPI best practices and our code is organized logically. Here are our specific observations and recommendations for improvement.

Architecture & Structure: 
Strengths:
-	Clean separation of concerns with proper routing, services, and models
-	Good use of FastAPI features (lifespan, dependencies, routers)
-	Proper project structure that scales well
-	SPA-friendly with template serving endpoints

Our File Structure:

tender_insight_hub/
├── app/
│   ├── routes/          
│   ├── services/        
│   ├── models
│   ├── templates/       
│   └── database.py      

Detailed Code Analysis

1. main.py - Overall Structure: 
python
Good use of lifespan context manager
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    yield

Proper router inclusion
app.include_router(tenders.router, prefix="/api/tenders", tags=["tenders"])

2. Security & Configuration: NEEDS ATTENTION
python
 Security concern - too permissive CORS in our code
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],   - Allows ALL origins in production!
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

Recommended fix for our production deployment:
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://localhost:8000",
        "https://ourdomain.com"  # Our production domain
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["Authorization", "Content-Type"],
)

3. Error Handling: CAN BE IMPROVED
python
Inconsistent error handling in our endpoints
@app.post("/api/tenders/summarize")
async def summarize_tender(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        # ... our code ...
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Summarization failed: {str(e)}"}  # ✅ Good!
    finally:
        # ... cleanup ...
        
But elsewhere in our health check:
@app.get("/api/health")
async def health_check(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        db.execute("SELECT 1")
        return {"status": "healthy"}  
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}  

Recommended: Use HTTPException for consistency across our API
from fastapi import HTTPException

except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=500, 
        detail="Internal server error during summarization"
    )

4. Code Duplication: IDENTIFIED IN OUR CODE
python
We have duplicate summarization endpoints
@app.post("/api/tenders/summarize")  # In our main.py
AND in our tenders_summarize.py router

Recommendation for our team: Choose one approach
Option A: Keep in main.py (simpler)
Option B: Move entirely to router (more organized)

5. Template Handling: GOOD with minor improvements needed
python
 Good fallback handling in our template function
def read_html_template(template_name: str = "base.html"):
    try:
        with open(template_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return fallback_template  - Good practice

Our template reading could be more efficient with caching
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=10)
def read_html_template(template_name: str = "base.html"):
 6. Database & Dependencies:  SOLID
python
Good use of FastAPI dependencies in our code
@app.get("/api/health")
async def health_check(db: Session = Depends(get_db

 Proper database session management in our application
Performance & Scalability

Our Strengths:
-	Async/await used appropriately throughout our code
-	Database connection pooling via SQLAlchemy
-	Template caching (implicit via variable assignment)

Areas We Can Improve:
python
Our large file handling could be optimized
@app.post("/api/tenders/summarize")
async def summarize_tender(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
     No file size validation in our current implementation
     Let's add file size limits to our upload handler:
    from fastapi import HTTPException
    
    MAX_FILE_SIZE = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
    file_size = 0
    chunk_size = 8192
    
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        while content := await file.read(chunk_size):
            file_size += len(content)
            if file_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
                raise HTTPException(413, "File too large")
            f.write(content)
Security Assessment

What We're Doing Well:
-	SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM
-	File type validation for uploads
-	Temporary file cleanup  in our summarization

Areas Our Team Should Address:
1. CORS too permissive (as mentioned)
2. No rate limiting on our summarization endpoint
3. No file virus scanning for uploads
4. Error messages might expose internals in some endpoints

Our Code Quality Metric

Category	Rating	Comments
Structure	Excellent	Clean separation of concerns
Error Handling	Good	Inconsistent but functional
Security	Fair	CORS needs our attention
Performance	Good	Async operations used well
Maintainability 	Excellent	Well-organized, readable
Documentation	Basic	Some endpoints documented



Priority Recommendations for Our Team

HIGH PRIORITY:
1.	Fix CORS configuration for our production deployment
2.	Standardize error handling across all our endpoints
3.	Remove duplicate summarization endpoint from our codebase

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
1.	Add file size limits for our upload endpoints
2.	Implement rate limiting for our summarization service
3.	Add request validation with Pydantic models throughout our API

NICE TO HAVE:
1.	Add comprehensive logging to monitor our application
2.	Implement response caching for our search results
3.	Add API versioning as our application evolves

What's Working Well in Our Implementation

1.	FastAPI best practices followed correctly throughout
2.	Good project structure that's maintainable by our team
3.	Proper async handling in our file operations
4.	Clean dependency injection pattern in our routes
5.	Good template management with fallbacks for our SPA

Our Overall Assessment: B+
Our code demonstrates **strong understanding of FastAPI and good software architecture principles. With the security improvements and some consistency fixes, our application could easily be an A-grade production application.
The foundation our team has built is excellent - we should focus on the high-priority security items first, then gradually implement the other improvements.

# Code Review Report- Week 5 and 6
**Code Reviewer:** Ayanda Girly Khalo

## 1. Overview  
The Tender Management System is a **FastAPI backend** with a **JavaScript frontend** that allows users to:  
- Search and save tenders to a personal workspace  
- Track tender status through various stages (pending, interested, submitted, etc.)  
- Add team notes and tasks to tenders  
- Perform AI-powered tender analysis and matching  

---

## 2. Functionality Assessment  

### Working Correctly  
- **Tender Search & Saving:** Users can search and save tenders to their workspace  
- **Status Management:** Status updates work correctly (pending → interested → submitted, etc.)  
- **Workspace Organization:** Tenders are properly organized with filtering options  
- **Basic CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and delete operations function as expected  

###  Partial Implementation  
- **Notes System:** Backend implemented, frontend integration still needs testing  
- **AI Integration:** Summarization and matching exist but require better error handling  
- **User Management:** Basic `user_id` support; full authentication not yet implemented  

### Not Working / Issues Found  
- **Duplicate Routes:** Conflicting endpoint definitions (now resolved)  
- **Database Schema Mismatches:** Model-table mismatches found initially  
- **Frontend-Backend Communication:** Some API calls failed due to CORS and endpoint issues  

---

## 3. Endpoints Analysis  

### Workspace Routes (`/api/workspace/*`)
```python
POST /tenders              # Save tender to workspace 
GET /tenders               # Get workspace tenders  
PUT /tenders/{id}/status   # Update tender status 
DELETE /tenders/{id}       # Remove tender 
GET /tenders/{id}/notes    # Get tender notes 
POST /tenders/{id}/notes   # Add note to tender ️
Tender Routes (/api/tenders/*)
POST /summarize-from-data  # AI summarization 
POST /{id}/match           # Tender matching 
4. Strengths
Architecture

5. Areas for Improvement
 High Priority
Input Validation & Security
from pydantic import validator, Field

class NoteCreate(BaseModel):
    content: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=1000)
    is_task: bool = False
    
    @validator('content')
    def content_not_empty(cls, v):
        if not v.strip():
            raise ValueError('Note content cannot be empty')
        return v.strip()

Authentication & Authorization
@router.post("/tenders")
async def save_tender_to_workspace(
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    workspace_tender = WorkspaceTender(user_id=current_user.id)

⚙️ Medium Priority
Database Optimization
class WorkspaceTender(Base):
    tender_id = Column(String(255), index=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, index=True)
    status = Column(String(50), default="pending", index=True)

Error Handling Consistency

    success: bool = False
    error_code: str
    message: str
    details: Optional[Dict] = None

 Low Priority
Advanced Features

Add soft delete with timestamps

Implement logging for debugging and monitoring

6. Validation Enhancements Needed
Backend Validation
class WorkspaceTenderCreate(BaseModel):
    tender_id: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=255)
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=500)
    ...

Frontend Validation
class TenderValidator {
    static validateSaveData(data) {
        const errors = [];
        if (!data.tender_id?.trim()) errors.push('Tender ID is required');
        if (!data.title?.trim()) errors.push('Title is required');
        if (data.title?.length > 500) errors.push('Title too long');
        return errors;
    }
}

7. Frontend Improvements
Error Handling & Feedback
class ApiClient {
    async request(endpoint, options = {}) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}${endpoint}`, options);
            if (!response.ok) throw new ApiError(response.status, await response.text());
            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            this.handleError(error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
}

State Management
class WorkspaceStore {
    constructor() {
        this.tenders = [];
        this.notes = new Map();
    }
}

Performance Optimizations

Debounced search to reduce API calls

Efficient rendering using document fragments

Cleanup handlers to prevent memory leaks

8. Security Recommendations
Backend Security
# Rate Limiting

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)

@router.post("/tenders")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")


Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

Restrict CORS to trusted domains

9. Testing Recommendations
Backend Tests (pytest)
def test_save_tender_to_workspace():
    response = client.post("/api/workspace/tenders", json={"tender_id": "test-123"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["success"] is True

Frontend Tests (Jest)
describe('Workspace Management', () => {
    test('should save tender to workspace', async () => {
        const mockTender = { id: 'test-123', title: 'Test Tender' };
        global.fetch = jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ ok: true, json: () => ({ success: true }) }));
        await saveTenderToWorkspace(mockTender.id);
        expect(fetch).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
});
