## Week 2 Team Lead Report  
**Lead:** Mawela Mpho Precious  

### Responsibilities / Decisions Made
This week, we successfully implemented data extraction from the **Tender Insight Keyword Search, Filtering & Match Ranking** feature. Key achievements include:

- Users can enter free-text keywords (e.g., “road construction”, “security services”) into a search bar.  
- The backend performs a search on tender descriptions retrieved from the **OCDS eTenders API**.  
- Search results can be filtered by:  
  - Province  
  - Buyer (organ of state)  
- Users apply filters after receiving the initial search results to narrow down the tenders.  
- Once filters are applied, users can view the tenders that match their criteria.  

### Key Decisions Made
- We decided to divide parts of the work among team members to improve efficiency and ensure each feature could be developed in parallel.  

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Initially, the API was not extracting data correctly, which blocked progress. After troubleshooting, we resolved the issue, and the API is now fully functional.  
- Filtering by **submission deadline window** and **budget range** was not possible at first. While full filtering is still under refinement, we implemented partial filters (province and buyer) to ensure progress.  

### Reflections on Teamwork and Leadership
- Dividing tasks allowed the team to work efficiently and made collaboration smoother.  
- Leading the team taught me the importance of clear communication and quickly addressing blockers to keep progress on track.  
- Working through the API issues together reinforced the value of persistence and problem-solving in a team setting.
